# UX/UI Design Lecture

## Notes
- Usability: measure of how effectively a person can, navigate an interface, find information, achieve specific goals
- Aesthetic design trends move fast, usability remains
- Focus on what the main purpose/content of the site is
- Jakob's Law - users spend their time on other sites, where they form expectations
- Follow best practices from more popular websites and user test with real people
- Website organization can change based on purpose/size of website (sequence vs hierarchical vs weblinked)


## Exercise
Our website: https://www.007museum.com/

- Pictures are too big
- No navigation control - just one really long scrolling page
- Unclear what purpose/most important content is
- Borders meant for emphasis end up making navigation more confusing
- Text is too long
- Text screenshots
