                    <h3>The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have become essential tools for web developers. These frameworks help developers build interactive, dynamic
                            websites faster and more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript frameworks offer a variety of benefits, including component-based architectures, easier state management, and a
                            growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. This makes them a powerful choice for building modern web applications.

                    <h3>The Importance of Web Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>As the web becomes more integral to daily life, web accessibility is more important than ever. Developers must ensure that websites are usable by people of all abilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            There are many guidelines and tools available to help developers create accessible websites, including using semantic HTML, providing alt text for images, and ensuring
                            keyboard navigation works smoothly.

                    <h3>The Role of Web Performance</h3>

                            Fast-loading websites are crucial for user experience and SEO rankings. Optimizing web performance includes techniques like minimizing file sizes, using lazy loading, and
                            leveraging modern image formats like WebP.
