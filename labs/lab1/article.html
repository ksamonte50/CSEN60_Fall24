                    <h3>The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue have become essential tools for web developers. These frameworks help developers build interactive, dynamic
                            websites faster and more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript frameworks offer a variety of benefits, including component-based architectures, easier state management, and a
                            growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. This makes them a powerful choice for building modern web applications.

                        <p>As the web becomes more integral to daily life, web accessibility is more important than ever. Developers must ensure that websites are usable by people of all abilities.</p>

                            leveraging modern image formats like WebP.
